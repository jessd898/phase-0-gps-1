What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
  I was struggling on what steps go where and didn't always create a feature branch initially. The GPS was a huge help in clarifying a lot about cloning, pulling and comparing the master branch, fetching and working with merge conflict. This was very helpful to reinforce the concepts we are learning. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
  I asked the guide when we should commit vs pushing up to GitHub. She had a very helpful answer that you commit often and push up a few times a day in a real life experience. 

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
  Most questions towards to guide were clarifying that we were on the right track and she usually confirmed. My partner and I went back and forth regarding if we thought we were on the right path before we got too deep. 

What still confuses you about Git?
  Something that still confuses me a little is still when you merge onto the master branch and where this falls in the steps. Is it after you complete all of your commits and right before you push up to GitHub or just when you have Merge conflicts? 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
  I thought this was great! I think my partner and I worked really well together and we were on the same pace. I liked that halfway through we switched roles because I think I can learn differently through both situations. Overall great and cant wait for the next one!
