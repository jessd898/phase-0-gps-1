What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
The frequency with which I should be making commits and pushing to Github was a bit confusing. Another concept that I am still struggling with and will just have to get used to and keep conscious of is that I don't initially create branches when beginning new work.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The guide actually clarified directly during the GPS the frequency with which we should be committing and pushing work which was very helpful. It's great to also be working with someone so they can catch and remind when a feature branch should be used.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I made sure to clarify with my pair that I was actually typing in the right code when I was driver just to double check that the correct sequence and terms were being used. Our guide was mostly observing our work and gave us a chance to discuss roadblocks before jumping in when we really got stuck or went in the wrong direction. Most of the questions we had for the guide had to do with clarifying instructions.

What still confuses you about Git?
I think that Git itself is not a difficult concept, but making sure that I build into muscle memory a clean and proper workflow will be something that just takes a lot of practice and purposeful awareness at first.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was a great experience! I enjoyed working with both my pair and the guide and appreciated that the guide let us try to work through things on our own, even though it definitely took us a while to get through everything! I think in general that getting comfortable with remote pairing will take a few more sessions but overall do enjoy learning with this model!
